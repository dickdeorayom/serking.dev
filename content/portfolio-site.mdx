I was using the traditional HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap) for my portfolio site. This was fine, but I didn't like having to deal with the staticity of the site every time I will add new data to it. Everything is hardcoded and I was getting frustrated every time I make changes to the site.

Like many others, I needed to improve my skills so I started learning React. I immediately saw how extremely competent it is and how creating dynamic websites become easier due to its features. So I decided to redesign and replace the technology I used on my portfolio site with React.

As a way to study, I also incorporated in this portfolio the use of markdowns, such as the one I used writing this note and the use of JSON for dynamicity.

I'm planning on recreating this portfolio website using Next.js once I get the hang of using React.
