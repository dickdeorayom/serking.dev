The **SALIKSIK: UPHSL Research Repository** is a web-based Institutional Repository for disseminating, archiving and preserving digital copies of academic papers of the **University of Perpetual Help System Laguna - Bi√±an Campus**.

This is my Capstone Project during my senior year in college and is currently planned on being implemented for the use of the University.

I served as the main front-end developer of the system project, but I also did some of its backend such as the **login system**.

**Technology used:**

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, MySQL
