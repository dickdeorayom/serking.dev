&nbsp;

<span className="page__content">
This project is developed during my 3rd year in college and is a requirement for one of my subjects for the course. It is a simple CRUD application for the residents of Barangay Malaban in Bi√±an, Laguna.

This is the first-ever system project that I worked on, and I managed to develop this system project all by myself without having prior knowledge to software development.

Unfortunately, I have lost the source code for this project due to a storage failure, and I was not yet aware of version control system such as **Git** and **GitHub** at the time for backup.

**Technology used:**

C# Windows Forms, Microsoft SQL Server
