Group Study Gallery is a website my friend and I created for our circle. I mostly served as the front-end developer while my friend did the backend with a little help from me.

The objective of the project is to have an online gallery of all of our photos during our days in college and thereafter.

Unfortunately, the website is password-protected and only those in my college circle of friend has access to it.

**Technology used:**

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP
