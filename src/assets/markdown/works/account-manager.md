**Account Manager** is more of a personal web application for my own use.

I seem to have a hard time remembering my social media and other accountsâ€™ emails, usernames and passwords so I created the app that stores my login credentials and is accessible anywhere given that it is web-based.

Currently, some of my friends uses the app for storing their other not-so-sensitive accounts.

**Technology used:**

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, PHP, MySQL
