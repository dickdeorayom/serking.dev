I was using the traditional HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap) for my portfolio site. This was fine, but I didn't like having to deal with the staticity of the site every time I will add new data to it. Everything is hardcoded and I was getting frustrated every time I make changes to the site.

As a way to study, I also incorporated in this portfolio the use of markdowns, such as the one I used writing this note and the use of JSON for dynamicity.

I'm planning on recreating this portfolio website using Next.js once I get the hang of React.

**Technology used:**

React JS, JSON, Markdown, Bootstrap, jQuery, animate.css, markdown-to-jsx
