Finally land myself a job as a mobile app developer.

The company uses React Native for their projects and luckily, I have experience to the ecosystem of React (as proven in this site using React JS) so I had a bit of knowledge while on training.

React Native is very similar to React JS, and as someone who experienced using both firsthand, I can say that React JS is the way to go if planning to learn the framework.
