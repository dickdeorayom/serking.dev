                As a kid, books and video games were my companions, shaping my
                imagination and fueling my curiosity. The love affair with
                literature and video gaming started early, creating a parallel
                universe where stories unfolded in the pages of countless books
                and games. It was more than a pastime; it was a lifelong love
                affair with video games and the written word.

                These days, I spend most of my free time reading books,
                listening to music, playing video games or watching movies, TV
                series or anime.
            </p>

            <p>If time permits, I also hang out with my friends and family.</p>
