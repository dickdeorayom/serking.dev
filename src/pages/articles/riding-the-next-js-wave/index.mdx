Happy Halloween! ðŸ‘»ðŸŽƒ

Next.js has been giving me headaches because this is the first time I'm using it and I'm still no pro and cannot just adapt to it.

But in just a few chill weeks, diving into Next.js has been like the best thing that ever happened on my web development journey.Picture this: automatic routing doing its thing _(goodbye, React Router! You made my head ache more than Next.js did)_, making moving around my portfolio(and hopefully, futuree projects) a breeze.No fuss with manual links and routingâ€”just smooth sailing through my app.And that's just the beginning!

Getting cozy with data fetching has never been easy.Thanks to Next.js, I could fetch data left and right.It felt like I'd leveled up in the coding game. And then, bam, API routes entered the scene, turning my static app into a dynamic wonderland. Watching data flow effortlessly, I couldn't help but appreciate the elegance and simplicity that Next.js brings.Kudos to team working hard at Vercel for this one!

So, as I wrap this up, I'm not just a coder; I'm a happy explorer of Next.js.Learning has never been this cool, and Next.js is the MVP making it happen.

It truly is a blessing in disguise.

Here's to more coding adventures and the endless fun Next.js promises on this wild ride! ðŸš€
