                    It was a wild introduction to computing technology. Years
                    passed and I found myself tinkering with smartphones and
                    laptops, changing its stock ROM to custom ROMs and changing
                    the OS installed, respectively. I had a lot of fun doing it,
                    making me curious how software worked in general.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was then that I realized what career I wanted to pursue
                    and so I took <strong>BS Information Technology</strong> in
                    collegeâ€”and that&apos;s how the journey really started.
                </p>

                <p>Now, I am into software development.</p>

                    As a kid, books and video games were my companions, shaping
                    my imagination and fueling my curiosity. The love affair
                    with literature and video gaming started early, creating a
                    parallel universe where stories unfolded in the pages of
                    countless books and games. It was more than a pastime; it
                    was a lifelong love affair with video games and the written
                    word.
