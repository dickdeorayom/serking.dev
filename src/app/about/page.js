                    I&apos;m Serking and I&apos;ve been doing technology related
                    things since my early teenage years, though I only learned
                    programming when I started college.

                <p>Some highlights about me and my activities:</p>
                <p>
                    As a kid, books and video games were my companions, shaping
                    my imagination and fueling my curiosity. The love affair
                    with literature and video gaming started early, creating a
                    parallel universe where stories unfolded in the pages of
                    countless books and games. It was more than a pastime; it
                    was a lifelong love affair with video games and the written
                    word.

                    I was in my early teenage years when the world of computing
                    opened its doors to me. My journey has been a whirlwind of
                    exploration and innovation: picture a younger version of me,

                    embraced it with the same passion that defined my middle

                    Years passed and I found myself tinkering with smartphones
                    and laptops, changing its stock ROM to custom ROMs and
                    changing the OS installed, respectively. I had a lot of fun
                    doing it, making me curious how software worked in general.

                    It was then that I realized what career I wanted to pursue
                    and so I took <strong>BS Information Technology</strong> in
                    collegeâ€”and that&apos;s how the journey really started. Now,
                    I am into building PCs and software development.

                    These days, I spend most of my free time reading books,
                    listening to music, playing video games or watching movies,
                    TV series or anime.

                    If time permits, I also hang out with my friends and family.

                    I also have a dog named <strong>Yuko</strong>. A very good
                    partner and companion he is.
